About This Project

This project was a great experience but also quite stressful. I often found myself needing to finish it quickly, or else I would keep wanting to perfect it even more.
Reflection

I regret using Python for this project due to its heavy performance impact. If I were to redo it, I would choose Rust for better performance. Despite the challenges, this experience taught me a lot and brought me a step closer to my bigger dream.
